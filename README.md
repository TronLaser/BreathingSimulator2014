Breathing Simulator 2014

It's a bright Friday afternoon. You are sitting at home working on your computer when your mind begins to think about other things than code. You think about breathing, how it works and what your lungs do. Before you know it, you worst nightmare has come true. The horror that grips every person once in their lives.

You have just started manually breathing.
